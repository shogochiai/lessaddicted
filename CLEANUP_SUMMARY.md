## 📁 Final Extension Structure

```
extension-root/
├── _locales/
│   ├── en/
│   │   └── messages.json
│   └── ja/
│       └── messages.json
├── content.js         # Content script with list grayout feature
├── manifest.json      # Clean manifest without options page
├── popup.html         # All-in-one popup with 3 states
└── popup.js          # State management and features
```

## ✅ Features Consolidated in Popup

All functionality is now in the popup with three states:

1. **No List State**
   - Shows when no default list is selected
   - "Choose Default List" button to start setup

2. **Choosing List State**
   - Shows setup instructions
   - Opens X.com for list selection
   - Cancel button to abort

3. **List Selected State**
   - Shows current selected list
   - Update button (🔄) to change list
   - Delete button (🗑️) with confirmation
   - "Open X" button

### Additional Features:
- **Language Toggle**: EN/JA switch in header
- **Auto-grayout**: Disables non-selected tabs on X.com
- **Real-time Updates**: UI updates immediately on storage changes
- **Setting Mode Protection**: Re-enables all tabs during list selection

## 🧪 Testing

A manual test file has been created at `/manual-popup-test.html` that:
- Loads the popup in an iframe
- Provides controls to test all states
- Shows real-time storage contents
- Mocks Chrome APIs for browser-independent testing

To test:
1. Open `manual-popup-test.html` in Chrome
2. Use the control buttons to simulate different states
3. Verify all features work correctly

## 📊 Results

- **Files reduced**: From ~20 files to 6 core files
- **Code duplication**: Eliminated (options functionality merged into popup)
- **User experience**: Simplified with single popup interface
- **Maintainability**: Improved with cleaner structure
